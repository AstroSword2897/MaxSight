Session Manager

STUB - NOT INTEGRATED: This component is a placeholder implementation and not currently integrated into the main training pipeline.
See README.md for integration status. Future integration planned.

Manages therapy sessions, tracks performance, and generates progress reports.

PROJECT PHILOSOPHY & APPROACH:
=============================
This module implements "Skill Development Across Senses" and "Routine Workflow" barrier removal
methods. It's not just about logging data - it's about supporting users in developing visual and
spatial skills over time.

WHY SESSION MANAGEMENT MATTERS:
MaxSight is designed to support both immediate assistance (environmental awareness) and long-term
skill development (vision therapy). This module enables the latter by:
1. Tracking user performance over time
2. Identifying skill improvements
3. Adapting difficulty based on progress
4. Supporting gradual independence (reducing reliance on app)

This directly addresses the problem statement's emphasis on "Skill Development Across Senses" - users
don't just get information, they build skills that reduce their dependence on assistive technology.

HOW IT CONNECTS TO THE PROBLEM STATEMENT:
The problem asks: "What are ways that those who cannot see... be able to interact with the world
like those who can?" This module answers by supporting skill development - helping users improve
their visual and spatial abilities so they can interact more independently over time.

RELATIONSHIP TO BARRIER REMOVAL METHODS:
1. SKILL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS SENSES: Core implementation - tracks and supports skill development
2. ROUTINE WORKFLOW: Adapts to user patterns and needs based on session history
3. ENVIRONMENTAL STRUCTURING: Provides structured feedback on environmental awareness tasks
4. GRADUAL INDEPENDENCE: Enables reducing assistance as skills improve

HOW IT CONTRIBUTES TO VISUAL AWARENESS GOALS:
This module supports "Adaptive Visual Assistance" and "Visual Training" goals by:
- Tracking progress in object recognition
- Monitoring improvement in spatial awareness
- Adapting assistance levels based on performance
- Providing feedback that reinforces learning

TECHNICAL DESIGN DECISION:
We track multiple metrics (reaction time, accuracy, gaze path) because different vision conditions
affect different skills. This comprehensive tracking ensures we can adapt to each user's specific
needs and support their unique skill development journey.

class SessionManager:

    Manages therapy sessions.
    
    WHY THIS CLASS EXISTS:
    This class bridges the gap between "assistive technology" and "therapeutic tool." It enables
    MaxSight to support both immediate assistance (helping users navigate now) and long-term skill
    development (helping users improve their abilities over time).
    
    This dual purpose is critical because:
    - Immediate assistance: Users need help navigating safely right now
    - Skill development: Users want to improve their abilities to reduce dependence
    
    By tracking sessions and performance, this class enables MaxSight to adapt and support both
    goals simultaneously.
