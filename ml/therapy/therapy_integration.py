Therapy Integration Module for MaxSight
Uses enhanced scene descriptions in therapy exercises for attention, contrast, and edge recognition.

PROJECT PHILOSOPHY & APPROACH:
=============================
This module integrates scene descriptions into therapy tasks, enabling vision training exercises
that use real-world environmental information. This directly supports "Skill Development Across
Senses" by providing therapy exercises that are both practical and therapeutic.

WHY THERAPY INTEGRATION MATTERS:
--------------------------------
Therapy exercises need to be relevant to real-world use. By using actual scene descriptions in
therapy tasks, we:
1. Train skills that directly apply to navigation and environmental awareness
2. Provide context-aware exercises (attention, contrast, edge recognition)
3. Bridge the gap between therapy and practical use

This supports the problem statement's emphasis on "Skill Development Across Senses" by ensuring
therapy exercises develop skills that directly support independent interaction with the world.

HOW IT CONNECTS TO THE PROBLEM STATEMENT:
------------------------------------------
The problem asks for ways to help users "interact with the world like those who can." Therapy
integration answers by providing exercises that train the specific skills needed for real-world
navigation and environmental awareness, not just abstract vision training.

RELATIONSHIP TO BARRIER REMOVAL METHODS:
----------------------------------------
1. SKILL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS SENSES: Core implementation - uses scene descriptions for training
2. ENVIRONMENTAL STRUCTURING: Exercises use real environmental information
3. GRADUAL INDEPENDENCE: Exercises adapt difficulty based on performance

TECHNICAL DESIGN DECISION:
--------------------------
We integrate scene descriptions into therapy tasks rather than using abstract exercises because:
- Real-world context makes exercises more engaging and relevant
- Skills learned with real scenes transfer better to actual use
- Environmental descriptions provide natural training stimuli

        Attention training helps users focus on important objects in complex scenes. By using

        WHY CONTRAST TASKS:
        ------------------
        Contrast recognition is critical for users with vision conditions that affect contrast
        sensitivity (cataracts, glaucoma). By using real scene descriptions, users practice
        identifying objects with different contrast levels in realistic contexts.

        WHY EDGE TASKS:
        --------------
        Edge detection is fundamental for object recognition and navigation. By using real scene
        descriptions, users practice identifying edges and boundaries in realistic contexts,
        training skills that directly support navigation and obstacle avoidance.

        -----------------
        Spatial awareness is critical for navigation and environmental understanding. By using
        real scene descriptions, users practice understanding spatial relationships (left/right,
        near/far, above/below) in realistic contexts.
