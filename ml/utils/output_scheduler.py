Cross-Modal Output Scheduler
Manages frequency, intensity, and channel prioritization for accessibility outputs.

PROJECT PHILOSOPHY & APPROACH:
=============================
This module is central to MaxSight's "Clear Multimodal Communication" barrier removal method. It
transforms the technical problem of "what information to present" into the human-centered problem
of "how to present information in a way that's useful, not overwhelming."

WHY THIS APPROACH IS CRITICAL:
Users with vision/hearing disabilities have different needs:
- Blind users need audio (TTS) but may also benefit from haptics
- Deaf users need visual overlays but may also benefit from haptics
- Users with partial vision/hearing need hybrid approaches
- All users need information prioritized (hazards first, details second)

This module ensures information is presented appropriately for each user's needs, preventing
information overload while ensuring critical information is never missed.

HOW IT CONNECTS TO THE PROBLEM STATEMENT:
The problem statement asks for "Clear, Multimodal Communication" - this module implements exactly
that by:
1. Supporting multiple output channels (audio, visual, haptic)
2. Prioritizing information (urgent alerts interrupt low-priority)
3. Adapting to user preferences (verbosity, frequency, channel)
4. Preventing information overload (rate limiting, uncertainty suppression)

This directly supports the MVP features:
- "Reads environment" → Audio descriptions for blind users
- "Listens and alerts" → Visual/haptic alerts for deaf users
- "Personal mode" → Customizable verbosity and frequency

RELATIONSHIP TO BARRIER REMOVAL METHODS:
1. CLEAR MULTIMODAL COMMUNICATION: Core implementation - manages all output channels
2. SKILL DEVELOPMENT: Adjustable frequency/verbosity supports gradual independence
3. ROUTINE WORKFLOW: Adapts to user patterns and preferences
4. ENVIRONMENTAL STRUCTURING: Ensures structured information is presented clearly

HOW IT CONTRIBUTES TO VISUAL AWARENESS GOALS:
This module ensures that all the rich information from the CNN (detections, distances, urgency)
is presented in a way that's:
- Actionable (prioritized, clear)
- Non-overwhelming (rate limited, filtered)
- Appropriate (matches user's sensory capabilities)
- Customizable (adapts to user needs)

TECHNICAL DESIGN DECISION:
We use priority-based scheduling rather than time-based because:
- Hazards must interrupt everything (safety first)
- Users need control over information density (prevent cognitive overload)
- Different vision conditions need different information frequencies
- This supports the "Practical Usability & Safety Goals"

    Schedules outputs across audio, haptic, and visual channels.

    WHY THIS CLASS IS CRITICAL:
    Without this scheduler, the system would either:
    1. Overwhelm users with constant information (every detection announced)
    2. Miss critical information (no prioritization)
    3. Ignore user preferences (one-size-fits-all approach)
    
    This class solves all three problems by intelligently scheduling outputs based on:

    - Output: Scheduled outputs for TTS, visual overlays, haptic patterns

        WHY THIS METHOD IS CRITICAL:
        This is the core orchestration method that transforms raw ML outputs into a prioritized,
        filtered, user-friendly information stream. It solves the fundamental problem of
        "information overload" - without this, users would be overwhelmed with constant alerts.
        
        HOW IT SUPPORTS THE PROBLEM STATEMENT:
        The problem asks for information that helps users "interact with the world like those who can."
        Sighted people naturally filter information (ignore background, focus on important things).
        This method provides that same filtering for users with vision impairments by:
        1. Prioritizing hazards and important objects
        2. Filtering based on user preferences (frequency settings)
        3. Suppressing unreliable information (uncertainty threshold)
        4. Rate limiting to prevent cognitive overload
