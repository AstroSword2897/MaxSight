Adaptive Assistance Module for MaxSight
Ties verbosity and hazard alerts to user performance from session manager/therapy tasks.

PROJECT PHILOSOPHY & APPROACH:
=============================
This module implements "Adaptive Visual Assistance" - adjusting assistance levels based on user
performance to support gradual independence. This directly addresses "Skill Development Across
Senses" by reducing assistance as users improve, encouraging skill development rather than
dependence.

WHY ADAPTIVE ASSISTANCE MATTERS:
Fixed assistance levels create dependence. Adaptive assistance:
1. Starts with detailed descriptions (supports learning)
2. Gradually reduces detail as skills improve (encourages independence)
3. Increases detail when performance drops (provides support when needed)
4. Adapts hazard alerts based on user's demonstrated awareness

This supports the problem statement's emphasis on "gradually reduced assistance" - users don't
just get help, they develop skills that reduce their need for assistance over time.

HOW IT CONNECTS TO THE PROBLEM STATEMENT:
The problem asks for ways to help users "interact with the world like those who can." Adaptive
assistance answers this by supporting skill development - as users improve their visual and
spatial abilities, the system reduces assistance, enabling more independent interaction.

RELATIONSHIP TO BARRIER REMOVAL METHODS:
1. SKILL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS SENSES: Core implementation - adapts assistance to support learning
2. ROUTINE WORKFLOW: Adapts to user's demonstrated capabilities over time
3. GRADUAL INDEPENDENCE: Reduces assistance as skills improve, increases when needed

TECHNICAL DESIGN DECISION:
We use performance metrics (accuracy, reaction time, skill progression) rather than time-based
reduction because:
- Different users improve at different rates
- Performance-based adaptation is more responsive to actual needs
- Supports both learning (detailed when struggling) and independence (brief when skilled)
