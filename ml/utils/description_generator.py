Enhanced Description Generator for MaxSight
Generates natural, actionable descriptions with direction, distance, and context.

PROJECT PHILOSOPHY & APPROACH:
=============================
This module is central to MaxSight's core mission: "Removing Barriers for Vision & Hearing Disabilities."

WHY THIS APPROACH:
People with vision impairments need information about their environment in a format they can process.
Raw bounding boxes and class names are meaningless - users need actionable, spatial descriptions that
help them navigate and understand their surroundings. This module transforms technical ML outputs into
human-understandable language that directly supports independent navigation.

HOW IT CONNECTS TO THE PROBLEM STATEMENT:
The problem statement asks: "What are ways that those who cannot see and hear be able to interact 
with the world like those who can?" This module answers that by providing:

1. ENVIRONMENTAL STRUCTURING (Barrier Removal Method #1):
   - Converts raw detections into structured descriptions: "Door 2 meters ahead, handle left"
   - Labels surroundings in ways users can understand and act upon
   - Provides spatial context (distance, direction, height) that sighted people take for granted

2. CLEAR MULTIMODAL COMMUNICATION (Barrier Removal Method #2):
   - Generates descriptions suitable for TTS (text-to-speech) for blind users
   - Creates concise summaries for visual overlays for deaf users
   - Adapts verbosity based on user needs (brief/normal/detailed)

3. SKILL DEVELOPMENT ACROSS SENSES (Barrier Removal Method #3):
   - Provides consistent spatial language that helps users build mental maps
   - Gradually reduces detail as users improve (via verbosity levels)
   - Reinforces spatial understanding through repeated, structured descriptions

HOW IT CONTRIBUTES TO VISUAL AWARENESS GOALS:
This directly implements the "Environmental Awareness Goals" and "Spatial Awareness & Localization"
from the comprehensive requirements. It transforms the CNN's technical outputs (bounding boxes, 
class probabilities) into the kind of information that helps users:
- Understand where objects are relative to them (not just "door detected")
- Navigate safely ("Obstacle on left, move right")
- Build cognitive maps of their environment over time

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER COMPONENTS:
- Input: Receives detections from MaxSightCNN (object positions, classes, distances)
- Output: Feeds into CrossModalScheduler for TTS/visual/haptic presentation
- Integration: Works with SpatialMemory to provide contextual reminders
- User Experience: Enables the "Reads Environment" MVP feature ("User points phone → app says: 
  'Door 2 meters ahead, handle left'")

TECHNICAL DESIGN DECISION:
We use verbosity levels (brief/normal/detailed) rather than a single format because:
- Users with different vision conditions need different levels of detail
- CVI (Cortical Visual Impairment) users benefit from simplified, consistent formats
- Advanced users can reduce verbosity as their skills improve (gradual independence)
- This supports the "Routine Workflow" barrier removal method by adapting to user needs

class DescriptionGenerator:
    """
    Generates natural language descriptions from model outputs.
    Provides directional cues, distance estimates, and contextual information.
    
    WHY THIS CLASS EXISTS:
    The CNN model outputs technical data (bounding boxes, class probabilities, distance zones).
    Users with vision impairments need this translated into actionable language. This class bridges
    that gap by converting technical ML outputs into natural descriptions that support independent
    navigation and environmental understanding.
    
    DESIGN PHILOSOPHY:
    Every description is designed to answer: "Where is it, how far, and what should I do?"
    This aligns with the project's focus on practical usability - descriptions must be immediately
    actionable, not just informative.

        WHY THIS MATTERS:
        Directional cues are critical for navigation. A sighted person can see "door on the left"

        perspective (bounding box position) into user-relative directions that support safe navigation.
        
        This directly addresses the "Spatial Awareness & Localization" goal: helping users understand
        where things are in 3D space relative to them. Without direction, "door detected" is useless
        for navigation - "door slightly left" is actionable.

        CORE FUNCTION - WHY THIS EXISTS:
        This is the heart of MaxSight's "Environmental Structuring" approach. It transforms a technical
        detection (class="door", box=[0.3, 0.5, 0.2, 0.3], distance=0) into actionable information:
        "Door 2 meters ahead, slightly left, at eye level".
        
        This directly implements the MVP feature: "User points phone → app says: 'Door 2 meters ahead,
        handle left' or 'Stop sign.'" Without this transformation, users get raw technical data they
        cannot act upon.
        
        HOW IT SUPPORTS DIFFERENT VISION CONDITIONS:
        - Brief mode: For users who need minimal information (CVI, cognitive overload)
        - Normal mode: Standard actionable descriptions (most users)
        - Detailed mode: For users learning spatial relationships or needing full context
        
        This adaptive verbosity supports "Skill Development Across Senses" - users can start with
        detailed descriptions and gradually reduce to brief as they build spatial awareness.
        
        RELATIONSHIP TO SAFETY:
        Urgency levels are prominently featured because safety is paramount. A "door" is different
        from a "vehicle approaching" - this function ensures hazards are clearly communicated,
        supporting the "Safety-Oriented Visual Awareness" goal.

        that prevents collisions, falls, and disorientation. This supports the "Safety-Oriented Visual
        Awareness" goal and is essential for independent mobility.
        
        HOW IT CONNECTS TO THE PROBLEM STATEMENT:
        The problem asks: "What are ways that those who cannot see... be able to interact with the
        world like those who can?" Navigation guidance is a direct answer - it provides the spatial
        awareness that sighted people take for granted, enabling safe, independent movement.
        
        RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER FEATURES:
        - Works with urgency scoring to prioritize hazards
        - Integrates with distance estimation to focus on immediate obstacles
        - Feeds into CrossModalScheduler for haptic/audio alerts
        - Supports the "Navigation Assistance" feature from Sprint 3
